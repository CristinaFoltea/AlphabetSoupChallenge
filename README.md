How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?

Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

1. Removed highly distributed column
2. Binning and drop columns
3. Changed the number or neurons
4. Changed the number of layers
5. Change the number of epochs
6. Different types of activation function for input and output

If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?

To solve this clasification problem I would try using random forest because:
 - It handles well tabluar, nonlinear data
 -
